# Linear-Regression-Model
A simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on floor size. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation through cost function visualization.

The model is trained using gradient descent and evaluated against a test dataset to assess its performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## How to run the code?
- Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
    pip install numpy matplotlib

- Place your dataset files (train.txt and test.txt) in the project directory.

- Run the main script:
  python simple_regression.py


## RESULTS

The program generates two figures:

Figure 1: A plot of the cost function versus the number of epochs during training. It shows how the cost decreases as the model learns.

Figure 2: A plot displaying the training data, test data, and the regression line fitted by the model.
